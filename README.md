This project will look at your HTML file and concatenate shaders as needed. It will also start a running web server so you can easily test your project locally.

First make sure you have all dependencies installed by entering this directory on the command line and running:

`npm install`

Then, to compile your shaders and start the web server enter the following on the command line:

`npm run start`

You should then be provided a URL to see your running project, most likely `http://localhost:1234`.
